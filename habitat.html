            The cumulative effects of human activities that involve interference with water bodies
            containing salmon have led to the degredation of salmon habitat. There is a necessity for a 
            <em>place-based management approach</em> that advocates for the management of salmon within their specific
            ecosystems, ensuring that harvest practices are tailored to local conditions. An aspect of this approach includes
            certain strategies such as eliminating bycatch which refers to discarded catch of marine species and unobserved mortality due to a 
            direct encounter with fishing vessels and gear. The central focus is not on "growing" more salmon but about
            eliminating barriers to their natural life processes and ensuring habitats are maintained for future generations.
